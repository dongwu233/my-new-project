# Running Master

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

A running instructor system to help runners keep suitable speed and breathing in real time. The system detects peopleâ€™s heartbeat, speed and breathing when running and gives suggestions accordingly to improve performance.


## Background

Many people feel exhausted and can not insist when they run without proper skill and technique. If beginners can arrange their speed and breathing properly, they are more likely to enjoy the process of running and challenge themselves.


## How is it used?

Users need to install the application of Running Master in smart watches so that users' data of hear beat and breathing can be collected by watches and earphones and analysed in real time. Runners will be noticed to change their speed/breathing if they run too fast/slow to insist on finishing their goals or they should try to keep a suitable heartbeat rate. It will be helpful for runners to keep or improve their performance.

## Data sources and AI methods

The data needed is some running status data from skillful runners, including speed,heartbeat rate, breathing frequency. Plenty of high-quality data should be available for this kind of application to train supervised learning models. Neural network models may be helpful to extract features from plenty of raw data and deal with the real time tasks. 

## Challenges

Some variables may affect the performance of the system, such as sounds of wind (affecting the recognition of breathing frequency) or the difference grounds (affecting speed and energy) when runners are running.  

## What next?

Use more IOT devices to get more data (like wind speed) to provide better suggestions.
